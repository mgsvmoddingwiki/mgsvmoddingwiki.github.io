This page covers tips for using the wiki, some of which are non-obvious so worth skimming through even as a savvy user.

## Search

The search box is quite simple in it's current form, acting more like a filter. It will return the first matches for a query from anywhere on a page (whether a tag, title, body text or URL) in alphabetical order.

> **Tip:** if you know the beginning word of a page title you can typically filter results better by adding a forwardslash to the start of the query (eg: `/FoxKit`), since it's contained in the page URL.
>
> Alternatively if you know a page title contains a colon you can search using that which similarly improves results (eg: `FoxKit:`).

![`/Foxkit` as query. Without using these tips the 'FoxKit' page doesn't show in results normally, despite being the most relevant.](/assets/Meta-Wiki_Tips/Search - Forwardslash use.png){:width="600px"}

> **Tip:** if the search hasn't helped you can always visit the [All Pages](/Meta-All_Pages) list and Ctrl+F in the browser to find a title.


## Top toolbar buttons

At the top of every page are a row of icons. This table explains them beginning from leftmost icon to rightmost.

> **Tip:** if wanting to add a new simple, text-only page or wanting to make simple edits to a page then the Prose.io buttons with the colored backgrounds are the easiest way. For more about creating/editing pages see the [Creating/Editing a Page](/Meta-Creating_Editing_a_Page) guide.
